{"name":"AJAX Chat Plugins","tagline":"Plugins for frug's Ajax Chat","body":"This collection of plugins was developed by xMonsterx (Brandon Anzaldi) and NeCRoN99. They're designed to enhance the functionality of [Frug's AJAX Chat](http://frug.github.com/AJAX-Chat/). This can be integrated through the following lines (Verified to work in CustomAjaxChat.php):\r\n\r\n```php\r\nfunction parseCustomCommands($text, $textParts) {\r\n\r\nif($this->getUserRole() == AJAX_CHAT_ADMIN || $this->getUserRole() == AJAX_CHAT_MODERATOR || $this->getUserRole() == AJAX_CHAT_USER || $this->getUserRole() == AJAX_CHAT_GUEST) {\r\n  switch($textParts[0]) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, the plugins are just included inside of that. Easy, right?","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
